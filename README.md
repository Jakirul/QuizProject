# Project Description

This is a group project which asked us to create an online quiz game using React. Users can register to play or choose to play as a Guest (not logged in), however the unregistered user's score will not be counted on the leaderboard. Users can start a quiz with other players and choose the number of questions, level and trivia topic of their preference. Once the game has finished, they can see each player's results of the game, as well as the overall scores for each player in the leaderboard.
